# GDP-VS-Republican-Vote
For this statistical analysis, we decided to take one of America’s monumental political events and explore the effect of its swing states in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP provides an “economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate” (Chappelow). After the 2016 presidential election, we wanted to analyze the following dataset to see if the 2016 swing states had any or no effect on America’s GDP. Does change in GDP have an effect on election outcomes? More specifically, does the effect of GDP affect the change in percentage of republican votes (2012-2016) for counties in the twelve swing states. After briefly assessing several different datasets, we found a compilation of data that would be beneficial in helping define and answer our research question.
